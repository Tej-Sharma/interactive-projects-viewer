# 👁 Frontend

## Summary

The goal of this test is to make you code a small ReactJS app. We have prepared a [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) app for you, but please change whatever you want (CSS files, HTML structure, JS structure...).

---

Studio42 is a company that has worked with different partners in Africa.
They would like to showcase on a map the projects they have worked on.

The app will have just one page, the one showcasing the projects on the map.

- By default the map should be a simple representation of the African continent with the countries' borders highlighted, nothing else.

- Clicking on a country should open a tooltip connected to the selected country, listing the projects (the company and the project's description) for that country.

- Clicking outside an opened tooltip, should close it right away.

- You cannot have multiple tooltip opened at the same time.
  In addition to the map, there should be on the page a way to filter the projects in the tooltips by the kind of service provided (Strategy, Infrastructure, Engineering, Design). So if the service `Engineering` is selected, only Engineering projects should be visible when a country's projects are displayed.

To give you an idea, here is an example of what the Map could look like:

![map](/doc/map.jpg)

## 📔 Data

In the `data` repository at the root of the project, you'll find three json files holding the data. You can use the json files as a database replacement.

- projects
- countries
- services

## 🛠 Installation

We're using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) here:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

# 🗃 Backend

## Summary

The goal of this test is to make you code a small Express.js app. We have prepared a minimal express app for you, you'll find it at the root of the repository `/server/`, but please change whatever you want.

---

Update both the React and the Express app so that the data are now handled and provided by the backend app instead of the Json files. The data should be store in a database (PostgreSQL or mongoDB), you are free to decide how the database schema should be structured.

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) + PostgreSQL `or` [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) + MongoDB
